# axon 01.py

## Overview
This script defines a neural network model for a chatbot using PyTorch. The model consists of a simple feedforward network with two hidden layers. The network is designed to process input data (likely text) and output a response based on training data.

## Key Features:
- Neural network built using PyTorch's `nn.Module`.
- The model consists of two fully connected layers: `l1` and `l2`.
- Includes a basic structure for a chatbot training pipeline using the `.pth` file for the trained model.

## Dependencies:
- torch
- numpy
- random
- pyttsx3
- tkinter

## Usage:
1. Ensure that you have installed the required dependencies.
2. Load your pre-trained model (`chatbot.pth`) and feed in the necessary input for processing.
